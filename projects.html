              <a class="link" href="https://matematicas.uam.es/~qed/index.html" target="_blank">QED</a> is a
              mathematics student association at <a class="link" href="https://www.uam.es/uam/inicio" target="_blank">Universidad Autónoma de Madrid</a>.
              It aims to bring people and mathematics closer together through many different
              activities and events. These include tournaments, talks by mathematicians
              from UAM and other universities, as well as students from all around the world,
              and the <a class="link" href="https://matematicas.uam.es/~qed/revista.html" target="_blank">QED magazine</a>,
              where students are encouraged to write articles about what they find
              interesting in mathematics or related to mathematics. It also
              contains mathematical challenges, interesting problems and interviews with
              teachers from different universities, as well as fictional interviews with
              several mathematicians from the past.

              This project was born during the summer of 2021, and I am proud to
              be a part of it from the beginning. As of right now, I have written
              some articles for the magazine, which will be available
              <a class="link" href="https://matematicas.uam.es/~qed/revista.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
