            <h3>Hausdorff measures and the Fourier transform</h3>
            <p>
              In my thesis, I study the Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff dimension in \( \mathbb{R}^n \).
              I begin by presenting the basic concepts and definitions and examining some of
              the most important properties of the Hausdorff measure, such as its relation with
              the Lebesgue measure. I later introduce the concept of Hausdorff dimension and
              work with similarities and self–similar sets in order to prove a result which grants
              the existence of such sets under specific conditions, along with a way to obtain their
              Hausdorff dimension.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the second part of the project, I explore the relation
              between the Hausdorff dimension of a set in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) and the energy integrals of Borel
              measures which provide said set with positive, finite measure. For this part I also
              make use of some concepts from distribution theory. This allows me to find an identity
              involving energy integrals of measures and the Fourier transform, thereby establishing
              a relation between the Hausdorff dimension and the Fourier transform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, I combine several results seen in previous chapters to study a geometric problem
              regarding Hausdorff dimension, and I prove an important theorem related to Falconer’s
              distance set conjecture, which states that if a Borel set A in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) has Hausdorff
              dimension strictly greater that \( n/2 \), then the set of distances between every pair of
              points in A has positive Lebesgue measure.
